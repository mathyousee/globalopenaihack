    "First, as a reminder, Semantic Kernel allows you to define Plugins (formerly known as Skills) which encapsulate one or more Functions. These functions are where you will engineer your prompts (as well as insert and access variables). There are three types of plugin functions supported:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Inline*: inline functions are written in your chosen native language. You create the prompt, any variables, and configuration options in your desired language.\n",
    "- *Semantic*: semantic functions are written in something closer to natural language. While this may initially seem too basic or limited, this non-traditional code can often be a very powerful approach in this A.I. world. (\"English is the new programming language.\")\n",
    "- *Native*: like inline functions, native functions are written in your chosen native language, but they allow you to wrap any code logic as a function to be used within the kernel."
